## Configuration

### Step 1 : Download

- For this pentest audit we are going to use this Metasploit instance :

https://www.hamon.tk/Metasploitable2.7z

With this instance you don't have the passwords to access the server.

- But you can also use these if the link is down :

https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/

### Step 2 : Virtualization product

Unzip the file

Use VMWare or VirtualBox to add the VM

### Step 3 : Virtual configuration

Put the machine under the same subnet as your attack machine

The IP of the Metasploitable 2 VM is 192.168.10.100/24

### Step 4 : Start

Start both VM

### Advise

Never expose the Metaploitable VM on internet, always in local

I recommand to use a Kalli VM to process the attack, you can found some preconfigured VM here :
